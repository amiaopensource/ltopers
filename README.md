# LTOpers Documentation #

## Installing LTOpers tools ##
You can easily install these tools using Homebrew. To install Homebrew, follow the [instructions](http://brew.sh/).

Install the LTFS utilities. Please use version 2.2 on the [Quantum site](http://www.quantum.com/serviceandsupport/softwareanddocumentationdownloads/ltfs/index.aspx?whattab=Third).

To install LTOpers tools, run the following commands:

`brew tap amiaopensource/amiaos`

(this taps the homebrew recipes of the amiaopensource account)

`brew install ltopers`

(current version is 0.1.10)

If it ever updates you can update via:

```
brew update
brew upgrade
```

(nb: this will update/upgrade every package you've installed using brew)

## Formatting LTO ##

**LTO tapes need to be formatted before they can be used. Run the formatlto script.**

The script will ask you select a deck (if you have more than one attached) and to name your tape. There are two different tape ID formats:
- the 6-char ID must be exactly 6 capital letters and/or numbers
- the 8-char ID must be exactly 6 capital letters and/or numbers, followed by 'L5', 'L6' or 'L7' specifying the LTO generation.

Examples:

```
Annnnn
BnnnnnL6
```

where nnnnn is a 5-digit sequential number, e.g. A00001, A00002, etc. respectively B00001L6, B00002L6, etc.

The script will format your tape in LTFS format, with no compression, and sets rules that allow smaller types of files to live in the index partition of the tape, which gives you faster access. If you need to change this, edit the mkltfs line in the script to suit your preferences.

**Remember to physically label the tape with the tape id!**

## Mounting LTO & Creating XMLs ##

**Put tape you want to mount in the deck (you do not have to push it in all the way).**

**Run the mountlto script to mount the tape.**

Script will check for attached tape drive, and will prompt for deck name if there are multiple drives.

**When prompted, enter the name of the tape to mount** (e.g. A00001 or B00001L6).

Tape will load in deck and mount. 

**In Finder, go to Go > Go to Folder, and enter /Volumes/$tapeid to navigate to tape in Finder.**

**To unmount the tape, Ctrl-C in Terminal.**

Whenever a tape is ejected, the script will export the tapeâ€™s index (as an xml .schema file) to $HOME/Documents/lto_indexes on your computer. If a .schema file for that tape already exists in that location, it will just update the existing schema file with any new data.

## Writing LTO ##

**To write data onto a tape, run the writelto script.**

**When prompted, enter the tapeid and the source directory.**

The script will run rsync twice the transfer the data to the LTO tape. It runs twice to address an unresolved problem with small-sized files not transferring properly (running it twice seems to fix the errors).

## Database Integration ##

LTOpers can integrate with the database reporting functions in [mediamicroservices](https://github.com/mediamicroservices).  For information on how to set up the database see the mediamicroservices' [readme](https://github.com/mediamicroservices/mm#configuring-premisfixity-logging-database).

If the database is activated and configured LTOpers will store information from LTO schema files, fixity information and PREMIS event information relating to LTOpers and microservices.

Database specific tools in LTOpers are `searchlto`, `ingestschemas` and `ingestcollectionchecksum`. Both `ingestchemas` and `ingestcollectionchecksum` are designed for importing already existing information to the database (LTO schema information and readback checksums respectively).  They can be run either on individual files or on directories containing multiple files.

`searchlto` is for performing searches against the lto schema information stored in the database.  It accepts either a media id or an lto id as an input and will return a list of matching service files. Options are `-h` display help, `-c` compare characteristics of an input file to records in the database, and `-f` show full results (this will show all matches to search term as opposed filtering for service files only).
